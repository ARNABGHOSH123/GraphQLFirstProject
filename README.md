# GraphQLFirstProject
This is my first project on graphql, nodejs and expressjs to get hold of some of the basic concepts and powers of the Facebook developed GraphQL specification over REST API 
and its integration with ReactJS.
This project creates a simple front-end with some books and their authors and can add a new book and the result is displayed by using graphql on top of 
mongodb present in the backend side.

# Application stack:-
Backend->NodeJS,ExpressJS,GraphQL(Middleware),MongoDB(NoSQL DB)
Frontend-> ReactJS,ApolloClient,HTML,CSS,JS

# Instructions
1) For the client, run npm install to install node_modules and then do nodemon app to run the react application development server
2) For the server, .env_sample provides the sample for providing the MONDB_URI. Provide your own URI and paste it in .env file in your local repository. Go to MongoDB official website to get a your own MONGODB_URI. Install the node_modules using npm install and then do nodemon app to run the backend server.
