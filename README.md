# GraphQLFirstProject
This is my first project on graphql, nodejs and expressjs to get hold of some of the basic concepts and powers of the Facebook developed GraphQL specification over REST API 
and its integration with ReactJS.
This project creates a simple front-end with some books and their authors and can add a new book and the result is displayed by using graphql on top of 
mongodb present in the backend side.

Application stack:-    Backend->NodeJS,ExpressJS,GraphQL(Middleware),MongoDB(NoSQL DB)
                       Frontend-> ReactJS,ApolloClient,HTML,CSS,JS
